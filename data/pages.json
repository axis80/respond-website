        "text": "Creating Plugins Plugins are a great way to extend Respond to meet the needs of your users. Packaged with Themes Plugins in Respond are packaged with your themes. This gives you flexibility to design the HTML produced by the plugins to meet the needs of your site and front-end framework. You create plugins in the resources\/themes\/theme-name\/plugins folder. When a site is created, the plugin is copied to public\/sites\/site-name\/plugins Plugins are created as HTML files (e.g. form.html). The file name of the plugin is import because it acts as an ID for the plugin. Referencing Plugins in Code The respond-plugin attribute is used to tell the system that the code contained within an element is generated by a plugin. &lt;div respond-plugin type=\"form\" form=\"contact-us\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt; In the above example, the plugin is set to a type of form. This tells Respond to pull the code from public\/sites\/site-name\/plugins\/form.html. Enabling Plugins in the Respond Editor You can enable the Respond visual editor to show your plugin by adding the following JavaScript to resources\/themes\/theme-name\/.private\/plugins.js. The file is copied to resources\/sites\/site-name\/plugins.js when the site is created. { action: \"respond.form\", selector: \"[respond-plugin][type=form]\", title: \"Form\", display: '&lt;svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"\/&gt;&lt;path d=\"M19 3H5c-1.11 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.89 2 2 2h14c1.11 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.89-2-2-2zm-9 14l-5-5 1.41-1.41L10 14.17l7.59-7.59L19 8l-9 9z\"\/&gt;&lt;\/svg&gt;', view: '&lt;div class=\"respond-plugin\"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"\/&gt;&lt;path d=\"M19 3H5c-1.11 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.89 2 2 2h14c1.11 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.89-2-2-2zm-9 14l-5-5 1.41-1.41L10 14.17l7.59-7.59L19 8l-9 9z\"\/&gt;&lt;\/svg&gt;&lt;span&gt;' + hashedit.i18n('Form') + '&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;', html: '&lt;div respond-plugin type=\"form\" form=\"contact-us\"&gt;&lt;\/respond-form&gt;', attributes: [ { attr: 'form', label: 'Form', type: 'select', values: ['respond.forms'] } ] } Setting Description action A unique identifier for your plugin. selector The CSS selector by which your plugin can be accessed by the editor. Typically, this will be [respond-plugin][type=plugin] where plugin is the name of your plugin. title The title of the plugin. Shown when the icon is hovered over. display The HTML display of the icon shown in the toolbar in the Respond editor. view (optional) Specifies \"default\" HTML that is replaced by the editor. This is recommended when the plugin contains dynamic data that should not be edited by the user. attributes The attributes allow you to configure the configure modal for the plugin. Each configurable item is mapped to an attribute on the plugin HTML. For example, in the form plugin, the form attribute sets the form attribute in the plugin HTML. More on Attributes Attributes are the primary means to pass data from the user to the plugin. They can pass plain text or specify the name of the form, gallery, or page to be used by the plugin. Setting Description attr The name of the HTML attribute to be set on the plugin. label The label for the field shown in the configure element modal type This can be set to text or select to show a text field or select field. values (if select is set as type) An array of values to be added on the select list. This can be a simple array of strings (e.g. ['Option 1','Option 2','Option 3']) or can be set as ['respond.forms'], ['respond.galleries'], ['respond.routes'], or ['respond.pages']. These special values automatically populate the select box with items created in Respond. Plugin Structure Plugins can be a simple as creating plain HTML. In fact, you can just specify the HTML in the plugins.json file. However, to get the full power of accessing Respond data, you need to use TWIG templates. The Twig templates allow you to access data in the system. An example of the form plugin is shown below. {% spaceless %} {% for form in forms %} {% if form.id == attributes.form %} &lt;form id=\"{{ form.id }}\" action=\"{{ site.api }}\" data-site=\"{{ site.id }}\" respond-form&gt; {% for field in form.fields %} &lt;div class=\"form-group\" data-id=\"{{ field.id }}\" data-label=\"{{ field.label }}\" data-type=\"{{ field.type }}\" data-required=\"{{ field.required }}\"&gt; &lt;label for=\"{{ field.id }}\" class=\"control-label\"&gt;{{ field.label }}&lt;\/label&gt; {% if field.type == 'text' %} &lt;input id=\"{{ field.id }}\" name=\"{{ field.id }}\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"{{ field.placeholder }}\" class=\"form-control\"&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.type == 'textarea' %} &lt;textarea id=\"{{ field.id }}\" name=\"{{ field.id }}\" placeholder=\"{{ field.placeholder }}\" class=\"form-control\"&gt;&lt;\/textarea&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.type == 'select' %} {% set options = field.options|split(',') %} &lt;select id=\"{{ field.id }}\" name=\"{{ field.id }}\" class=\"form-control\"&gt; {% for option in options %} &lt;option value=\"{{ option }}\"&gt;{{ option }}&lt;\/option&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;\/select&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.type == 'checkboxlist' %} {% set options = field.options|split(',') %} &lt;span class=\"radio list\"&gt; {% for option in options %} &lt;label class=\"radio\"&gt;&lt;input name=\"{{ field.id }}\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"{{ option }}\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ option }}&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/label&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;\/span&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.type == 'radiolist' %} {% set options = field.options|split(',') %} &lt;span class=\"checkbox list\"&gt; {% for option in options %} &lt;label class=\"checkbox\"&gt;&lt;input name=\"{{ field.id }}\" type=\"radio\" value=\"{{ option }}\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ option }}&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/label&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;\/span&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.helperText != '' %} &lt;span class=\"help-block\"&gt;{{ field.helperText }}&lt;\/span&gt; {% endif %} &lt;\/div&gt; {% endfor %} {% endif %} {% endfor %} &lt;button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\"&gt;Submit&lt;\/button&gt; &lt;span class=\"loading\"&gt; &lt;!-- ack: https:\/\/github.com\/jxnblk\/loading --&gt; &lt;svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\"&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path opacity=\".25\" d=\"M16 0 A16 16 0 0 0 16 32 A16 16 0 0 0 16 0 M16 4 A12 12 0 0 1 16 28 A12 12 0 0 1 16 4\"\/&gt;&lt;path d=\"M16 0 A16 16 0 0 1 32 16 L28 16 A12 12 0 0 0 16 4z\"&gt;&lt;animateTransform attributeName=\"transform\" type=\"rotate\" from=\"0 16 16\" to=\"360 16 16\" dur=\"0.8s\" repeatCount=\"indefinite\" \/&gt;&lt;\/path&gt;&lt;\/g&gt;&lt;\/svg&gt; &lt;\/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"success\"&gt;Form submitted successfully&lt;\/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"error\"&gt;There was an error submitting your form&lt;\/span&gt; &lt;\/form&gt; {% endspaceless %} Form Data Forms are created in the Forms UI in Respond.

Sites as Themes To build a theme for Respond 6, simply build a site and then add a theme.json configuration file to tell the CMS what containers can be edited and what elements can be dragged. Theme Settings The settings.json file should be placed in the .private\/settings.json folder for your theme. [ { \"id\": \"editable\", \"value\": \"[role=\\\"main\\\"]\" }, { \"id\": \"sortable\", \"value\": \".col, .column\" } ] Setting Description editable A comma separated list of selectors to elements that are editable sortable A comma separated list of selectors to elements that are sortable. These should be a container of relative placed elements. Default Content Default content is the content added to a new page created within Respond. Default content should be placed in the .default.html file in the root of the theme. Theme Best Practices BASE element Respond adds all links and images relative to the root of the site. As a result, pages in the theme must specify a base element relative to the root. For instance, pages in a \/page\/ subdirectory must have a base of &lt;base href=\"..\/\"&gt;. Sortable ellements must be positioned static or relative. These elements cannot be floated. Immediate children of sortable containers (see settings) must be positioned relative or static. They cannot be floated or positioned absolute. However, children of those children do not have that restriction. Specify a [role=\"main\"] One element on the page should be given a role=\"main\" attribute. Respond uses this as the main content of the page. This main content is searchable and added to the pages.json file so that it can be made available to plugins. Installing a theme Simply place the theme folder in resources\/themes.",

So when a user signs up for a site, signs up for a subscription, or sends an email from a form on your site, it all goes through PHPMailer. Default Configuration By default, email is sent out via the default mail provider configured on your server. If you followed the Digital Ocean installation or use another VPS, you probably don't have one. Some shared servers offer this as an option. But, we think it is much better to outsource to a provider that specializes in this. Email from the app is always sent out to the primary email setup on the account. Custom Configuration To setup a custom email provider, Respond provides an SMTP configuration option. This is located in the .env file in the root. Variable Description EMAILS_FROM The from email address for emails sent by the app. EMAILS_FROM_NAME The from name for emails sent by the app. IS_SMTP Specifies whether the email is sent via SMTP. SMTP_HOST The SMTP Host for the server sending the emails SMTP_AUTH The SMTP Auth flag. SMTP_USERNAME The username to access the SMTP server. SMTP_PASSWORD The password to access the SMTP server. SMTP_SECURE The type of security used by the server. SMTPENC_KEY The penc key used by the server. Customizing Email Content You can easily customize the content in your emails by just editing an HTML file.

        "title": "Respond - Privacy Policy",
        "description": "Learn how to create themes for Respond",
        "text": "Privacy Policy Your privacy is important to us. Here are a few of our core principles: We don't ask for information unless we need it We don't require any information to create a site, you enter as much or as little as you are comfortable with We only store what you enter on the server We use strong cryptography to store your password and do not store identifiable information in cookies\/session We use Stripe to process Credit Cards. We do not store your Credit Card Information. Website Visitors Like most website operators, Respond collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Responds purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Responds visitors use its website. From time to time, Respond may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Respond also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Respond only discloses logged in user addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below. Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information Certain visitors to Responds websites choose to interact with Respond in ways that require Respond to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Respond gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, Respond users who sign up for our service enter their email, name, password, and property information. We only require email, name, password, and address to create an account. All other information is supplied at the discretion of the user. Respond does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. Aggregated Statistics Respond may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Respond may monitor listings on the site. Respond may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Respond does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information Respond discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Responds behalf or to provide services available at Responds websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Responds websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Respond will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Respond discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Respond believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Respond, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Respond website and have supplied your email address, Respond may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with Respond and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Respond takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. Sessions A session is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Respond uses sessions to help Respond identify and track visitors, their usage of Respond website, and their website access preferences. Respond visitors who do not wish to have sessions placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse sessions before using Responds websites, with the drawback that certain features of Responds websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. Business Transfers If Respond, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Respond goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Respond may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. Ads Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Respond and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Privacy Policy Changes Although most changes are likely to be minor, Respond may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Responds sole discretion. Respond encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.",

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using\n        Respond\u2019s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Respond will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors\n        and affiliated organizations, as described above, Respond discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Respond\n        believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Respond, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Respond website and have supplied your email address,\n        Respond may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what\u2019s going on with Respond and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate\n        this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify\n        or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Respond takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying\n        information.\n      <\/p>\n      <h3>Sessions<\/h3>\n      <p>A session is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Respond uses sessions to help Respond identify and track visitors,\n        their usage of Respond website, and their website access preferences. Respond visitors who do not wish to have sessions placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse sessions before using Respond\u2019s websites, with\n        the drawback that certain features of Respond\u2019s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.\n      <\/p>\n      <h3>Business Transfers<\/h3>\n      <p>If Respond, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Respond goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\n        You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Respond may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.\n      <\/p>\n      <h3>Ads<\/h3>\n      <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about\n        you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Respond\n        and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n      <\/p>\n      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes<\/h3>\n      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Respond may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Respond\u2019s sole discretion. Respond encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.\n        Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.\n      <\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n",
